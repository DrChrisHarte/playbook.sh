# run through a runbook formatted as a markdown file 
# use heading 1 as document title, use heading 2 and 3 as steps
# execute code in triple quotes if proceeded by an execute tag
# 
# 
# usage: 
# 
# playbook.sh [--format] <markdown.md>
# 
# without format:
# 
# display TOC of markdown and ask which step to start on - default to 1
# 
# on each step, output the markdown section and ask the user to if they want to continue, skip, or abort.
# 
# continue - execute any automation and move to next section
# skip - move to next section without executing automation
# abort - exit the script
# 
# 
# read each line, extract headings keep track of numbering, print TOC to screen.
# prompt user to choose section number to start on or press enter to start from the top.
# 
# with --format
# read the markdown file and add section numbers to each heading automatically. Remove existing numbering if necessary
