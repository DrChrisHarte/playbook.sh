## Turn markdown files into automated playbooks

Playbook.sh is a simple command line program that reads a markdown file and guides the user through it section by section.  The script will present each section of the markdown file to the user and prompt them for what to do next. If a code block containing bash code is present in the markdown, the user may choose to continue to run that code or may choose to skip that section if they prefer.
